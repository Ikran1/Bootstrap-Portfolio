# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Creating a new portfolio website using bootstrap

## Description

In this project, I recreated my portfolio website using Bootstrap. Utelising Bootstrap's pre-designed components and responsive layout features, has helped me address various design challenges allowing me to create a responsive and professionally appealing website that functions on various screen sizes. Through this challenge, I have gained valuable skills in responsive web design and Bootstrap, enhancing my ability to create both visually appealing and seamless user experiences in future web development projects.

## Usage

Below is a screen recording showcasing the website and its functionality.
